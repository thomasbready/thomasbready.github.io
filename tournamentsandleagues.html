<h3> The FIFA World Cup</h3>
<h4>The FIFA World Cup is actually a multiyear tournament. The month-long finals occur every four years and 2022 is a championship year. 

Since the last Cup in 2018, soccer teams from around the world have competed in the qualification phase, a series of tournaments that determine the final field of 31 teams. (Thirty-two teams actually compete, but the host countrys team is guaranteed a spot.)

Once the finalists are decided, FIFA divides the competing teams into eight groups of four each.

When the soccer teams that compose these groups converge on Qatar for the 2022 World Cup, they compete in a multilayered tournament:</h4>

<h4>Intra-group competition:</h4> <h4> The soccer action kicks off with a nearly two-week long series of matches to determine a winning team and a runner-up team from each group. No one is eliminated from competition until the end of this round. At this point, everyone is just jockeying for position in the next phase of the Cup. Only the top two teams in each group move on to the Round of 16.</h4>

<h4>Round of 16:</h4><h4> The winning team and runner-up team from each group advance to the Round of 16. During this phase, each winning team competes against a runner-up team from a different group. From here on out, competition is said to be at the knockout stage.</h4>

<h4>Quarter-finals:</h4><h4> The eight winners from Round 16 battle it out in the quarter-final round for a spot in the semi-finals.</h4>

<h4>Semi-finals:</h4><h4> The four quarter-final round winners play in the semi-finals for a spot in the final.</h4>

<h4>Third-place playoff:</h4><h4> The losers of the semi-finals compete for third place.</h4>

<h4>Final match:</h4><h4> The top two teams fight for the FIFA World Cup title.</h4>
<h3>The UEFA European Championship</h3>
<h4>The UEFA European Football Championship, commonly known as the Euros, is the primary association football competition contested by the senior mens national teams of the members of the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA), determining the continental champion of Europe</h4>
<h3>The UEFA Champions League</h3>
<h4>What is the UEFA Champions League?

The UEFA Champions League is a soccer tournament of 32 teams that compete in five rounds for the right to be crowned the best club in European soccer.</h4>

<h4>How has the tournament changed since 1955?</h4>

<h4>The inaugural tournament, then known as the European Cup (up until 1992), had just 16 teams competing in four knockout rounds (first round, quarterfinals, semifinals and final). Real Madrid defeated Reims 4-3 to win the title in the first tournament.

In 1960, the tournament expanded to 32 teams (adding an additional round) and kept the rest of the format the same. In 1992, UEFA (Union of European Football Associations) changed the name of the tournament to the UEFA Champions League and replaced the first round with a group stage.

The 32 teams were split into eight groups of four, with each team playing the other three teams in their respective group in a double round-robin format. The winner and runner-up of each group advanced to the round of 16, where the teams would then continue the usual knockout-stage process (round of 16, quarterfinals, semifinals and final).</h4>

          

<h4>How are the teams selected?</h4>

<h4>The number of teams each association enters into the UEFA Champions League is based upon the UEFA coefficients of the member associations. These scores are generated by the results of clubs representing each association during the previous five UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League seasons. The higher an associations coefficient, the more teams represent the association in the Champions League and the fewer qualification rounds the associations teams must compete in.

Since the 2009-10 season, the UEFA Champions League offers two qualification "streams" for teams that do not receive direct entry to the tournament. The two streams are divided between teams qualified by virtue of being a domestic league champion, and those qualified by virtue of being second through fourth in their domestic league. Five teams from each qualifying stream earn a place in the group stage.


The other 22 teams qualified automatically, either as the defending UCL champion, the defending UEL champion or through their respective domestic leagues. Each of the top 12 ranked associations in the UEFA coefficients are guaranteed at least one spot, with more spots being allocated the higher a leagues coefficient is.</h4>

           

<h4>What happens once the 32 teams qualify?</h4>

<h4>The 32 teams are split into four different "pots," with the restriction that teams from the same association could not be drawn against each other. For the draw, the teams were seeded into four pots based on the following principles:

• Pot 1 contains the Champions League titleholders, the Europa League titleholders and the champions of the top six associations based on their UEFA coefficients. If either the Champions League or Europa League titleholders were one of the champions of the top six associations, the champions of the association ranked seventh, and possibly eighth, are also seeded into Pot 1.

• Pots 2, 3 and 4 contain the remaining teams, seeded based on their 2018 UEFA club coefficients.

Then, a team is drawn from each pot until there are eight groups of four.</h4>

     

<h4>How does the group stage work?</h4>

<h4>The 32 teams compete in a double round-robin format called the group stage. The group winners and runners-up advance to the round of 16, the first round of the knockout phase. The teams are ranked by points. Three points are awarded for a win, one point is awarded for a tie and no points are awarded for a loss. According to UEFA, if tied on points, the following tiebreaking criteria are applied:</h4>


<h4>1. higher number of points obtained in the group matches played among the teams in question.</h4>

<h4>2. superior goal difference from the group matches played among the teams in question.</h4>

<h4>3. higher number of goals scored in the group matches played among the teams in question.</h4>

<h4>4. higher number of goals scored away from home in the group matches played among the teams in question.</h4>
   

<h4>How does the knockout phase work?</h4>

<h4>A draw takes place for the round of 16. The 16 remaining clubs are split into two pots of eight, with one containing the winners of each respective group from the group stage and the other holding the runners-up.


A club is drawn from each pot to determine what the matchups would be, with the conditions that a winner and runner-up who played in the same group in the previous round cannot be drawn together again and that clubs from the same domestic league cannot play one another.

The quarterfinal and semifinal draws do not have clubs split into separate pots. As a result, any remaining club can be drawn together regardless of whether or not they are a group winner or runner-up, played in the same one in the group stage or are clubs from the same domestic league. As the draws for the quarterfinals and semifinals are held together before the quarterfinals are played, the identity of the quarterfinal winners is not known at the time of the semifinal draw.</h4>

<h3>    

<h4>Knockout-Phase Legs and Tiebreakers</h4>

<h4>Two teams are drawn together for each round of the knockout phase, apart from the final. The teams play two matches, with each squad playing one match at home. Each match is known as a "leg." The group winners host the second leg in the round of 16. The team that scores more goals over the two legs advances to the next round.

If the aggregate score is level, the away-goals rule is applied. Therefore, the club that scores more goals away from home over the two legs advances. If away goals are also equal, then extra time (an additional 30 minutes) is played. The away-goals rule is again applied after extra time. Therefore, if there are goals scored during extra time and the aggregate score is still level the visiting team advances by virtue of more away goals scored.


If no goals are scored during extra time, the winners are decided by a penalty shootout. In a penalty shootout, the team that scores more penalties in a frame of five attempts wins. If the two teams are still tied after five attempts, they continue to alternate players until one scores their penalty and the other does not.

In the final (which is played as a single match in a neutral venue), if the score is level at the end of normal time, extra time is played. If the score is still level after extra time, the winner is decided by a penalty shootout.</h4>

<h3>The UEFA Europa League</h3>
<h4>What is the UEFA Europa League?</h4>

<h4>The UEFA Europa League is a tournament involving 48 European club teams who compete across six rounds for the right to be crowned winners and to earn an automatic spot in the following seasons UEFA Champions League.</h4>

     

<h4>When Did The UEFA Europa League start?</h4>


<h4>The first UEFA Europa League tournament was held during the 1971-72 season, and it has been staged every year since.</h4>

     

How Has The Tournament Changed Since 1971?

The competition was referred to as the UEFA Cup until 2009. It was traditionally a pure knockout tournament featuring 64 teams, with two-legged knockout ties staged home and away until those 64 teams were eventually whittled down to just two. The final was also played over two legs until 1997–98, when the showdown became a one-off match.

The tournament adopted an initial group stage in the 2004-05 season, with teams being drawn into eight groups of five. Unlike the Champions League, the UEFA Cup group stage was played in a single round-robin format, with each team playing two home and two away games rather than home and away double-headers.

The top three teams in each of the eight groups qualified for the main knockout round along with the eight third-placed teams in the UEFA Champions League group stage. From then on, a series of two-legged knockout ties were played before a one-off final, traditionally held on a Wednesday in May a week before the Champions League final.

For the 2009–10 season, the competition was rebranded as the UEFA Europa League in an attempt to increase its profile. An extra eight teams entered at the group stage (to make 48 teams in total), which meant 12 groups of four playing in a double round-robin format, with the group winners and runners-up advancing to the round of 32 along with the eight third-place teams from the UEFA Champions League group stage. 

Qualifiers would then continue the usual knockout stage process through the round of 32, round of 16, quarterfinals, semifinals and final.

     

How Are The Teams Selected?

Qualification has changed significantly since 2009. All participants of the Europa League qualify either through their respective final standing in the domestic leagues or their performance in domestic cup competitions.

Generally, the higher an association is ranked in the UEFA coefficients, the later its teams start in the qualification process (there are four qualifying rounds in total). The complex coefficient system is generated by the results of teams representing each association during the previous five UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League seasons

Apart from the teams that qualify directly for the Europa League, each side eliminated from Champions League qualifying is given a second chance of European competition by being added to Europa League qualification. The six losing teams in the Champions League play-off round are automatically transferred to the Europa League group stage.

Heres the full breakdown of the 48 qualified teams:

• 17 teams that qualify directly to the group stage due to their association and club coefficients 

• 21 teams from the UEL qualifying process

• 6 losers of the UEFA Champions Leagues fourth qualifying round

• 4 non-domestic cup-winning losers of the UEFA Champions League third qualifying round

     

What Happens Once The 48 Teams Qualify?

The qualifying teams are split into four different pots, with each pot being ranked from No. 1 to No. 4. The highest-rated club coefficients go into Pot 1, the next highest rated in Pot 2 and so on. Teams are then drawn from each pot until there are 12 groups of four. Teams from the same association cannot be drawn against each other.

     

How Does The Group Stage Work?

Teams that are drawn together compete in a double round-robin format called the group stage, with the group winners and runners-up advancing to the Round of 32, the first round of the knockout phase. The eight third-place teams from the UEFA Champions League group stage join the 24 UEL group stage qualifiers in the Round of 32.

The teams are ranked by points won during the group stage. Three points are awarded for a win, one point is awarded for a tie and no points for a loss. According to UEFA, if tied on points the following tiebreaking criteria are applied:

1. higher number of points obtained in the group matches played among the teams in question.

2. superior goal difference from the group matches played among the teams in question.

3. higher number of goals scored in the group matches played among the teams in question.

4. higher number of goals scored away from home in the group matches played among the teams in question.

    

<h4>How Does The Knockout Phase Work?</h4>

<h4>A draw takes place for the Round of 32, the first round of the knockout phase. The 32 remaining teams are split into two pots of 16, with one containing the eight third-place teams from the UEFA Champions League group stage and the eight best UEFA Europa League group winners, and the other holding the four worst Europa League group winners and the Europa League group runners-up.

A club is drawn from each pot to determine what the pairings will be, with the conditions that a winner and runner-up who played in the same group in the previous round cant be drawn together, and that clubs from the same domestic league are also kept apart.

The Round of 16, quarterfinal and semifinal draws do not have clubs split into separate pots. This means that the remaining clubs can be drawn together regardless of where they finished in their group, or whether they played in the same group or are from the same domestic league. As the draws for the quarterfinals and semifinals are held together before the quarterfinals are played, the identity of the quarterfinal winners is not known at the time of the semifinal draw.</h4>

    

<h4>Knockout Phase Legs and Tiebreakers</h4>

<h4>Teams are paired together for each round of the knockout phase, apart from the final, playing two matches at each teams home stadium. Each match is known as a leg, with the group winners hosting the second leg in the Round of 32. The team that scores more goals over the two legs advances to the next round.

If the aggregate score is level after both legs, the away goals rule is applied. This means that the club that scores more goals away from home over the two legs qualifies for the next round. If away goals are also equal, then extra time (an additional 30 minutes) is played.

The away goals rule is again used as a tiebreaker after extra time. If there are goals scored during extra time and the aggregate score is still level, the visiting team advances by virtue of more away goals scored.

If no goals are scored during extra time, the winners are decided by a penalty shootout. The team that scores more penalties from five attempts each wins. If the two teams are still tied after five attempts, they continue to alternate until one team scores their penalty and the other does not.

In the final (which is played as a single match in a neutral venue), if the score is level at the end of normal time, extra time is played. If the score is still level, it’s followed by a penalty shootout.</h4>

<h3>The Emirates FA Cup</h3>
<h4>The Emirates FA Cup, also known as the Football Association Challenge Cup, is the world’s oldest soccer tournament that generally takes place during the course of an entire season from August until May. It has a storied history and is met each year with excitement from clubs big and small across the entirety of England. If you’re not too familiar with how this tournament works, then you’re in the right place.</h4>

<h4>FA Cup History</h4>
<h4>The FA Cup, named after England’s governing football organization The Football Association, made its debut in the 1871-72 season and has been played every single season since with the exception of seasons that took place during the two World Wars. The first-ever winners were Wanderers FC, who dissolved in 1887.

The most successful club in FA Cup tournament history is Arsenal, who have won 14 championships overall and are the current reigning title holders having won in the 2020 edition of the tournament.

The tournament has been known by many different names as it changes with each sponsor that picks it up, but it’s been the Emirates FA Cup since 2015 since Emirates Airlines secured the sponsorship. The most recent sponsor that preceded them was Budweiser who held the sponsor title from 2011 until 2014.</h4>

<h4>FA Cup Format</h4>
<h4>The FA Cup is a knockout tournament that is open to any club from the Premier League all the way down to the 10th level of English football. By default, all 92 clubs in the Premier League, EFL Championship, EFL League One, and EFL League Two are automatically entered at different stages of the tournament. The first six rounds of the competition are qualifying rounds where eligible lower teams battle it out to be one of the 32 to advance to the First Round Proper, where they face off against teams from League One and League Two.


Clubs from the Premier League and Championship enter in the Third Round Proper and finish out the competition from there. There are no seeds like many other tournaments, so each round matchups are selected at random by way of a draw.

The whole ordeal generally begins in August and goes through 12 full rounds, followed by a semi-final and then a final game in May. The Final always takes place at Wembley Stadium in London.

In all rounds through the Fourth Round Proper, games that end in a draw will be moved on to a replay at a later date, in which the two teams will meet again to try and settle the score in regular time. If the game is still tied at the end of the replay, they’ll settle the draw by playing 30 minutes of extra time followed by a penalty shootout if necessary.

All games after the Fourth Round that aren’t decided in regular time will go straight to extra time and then penalty shootout on the same day instead of moving onto a replay.</h4>

<h4>FA Cup Winners</h4>
<h4>As mentioned before, Arsenal won the most recent edition of the FA Cup in 2020, while also winning the trophy a total of 14 times in their history. They also hold the record for most appearances in an FA Cup Final with 21. They’re just two wins clear of the next closest club, which is Manchester United who have won the tournament 12 times, most recently in 2016.

As of January 2021, only one non-League team (division five and lower) has ever reached the quarter-finals, while no team below division two (EFL Championship) has ever reached the Final.</h4>

<h3>The English Premier League</h3>
<h4>The Premier League (sometimes referred to as the EPL, English Premier League outside of the United Kingdom) launched in 1992, and quickly became the worlds most popular sports league. Consisting of 20 teams, each club plays their opponents twice in a season, one match home and the other one away, equaling 38 matches during the course of the entire season that runs from August through May. Unlike many other European club leagues, the Premier League has no winter break and continues every week throughout the season except when theres a FIFA-mandated international break when many players from the Premier League will play for their respective countries in international games such as friendlies or qualification games for the World Cup or European Championship, and other regional competitions.

The main attractions of the Premier League are the vast number of world-class players, the different soccer styles among most teams, and the often noisy crowds up and down England and Wales. Many of the Premier League games feature unpredictable outcomes, where its often very difficult to predict where the clubs will finish in the standings (aka league table), as opposed to other leagues such as Spain where the top two teams (Barcelona and Real Madrid) always seem to win every week.

The Premier League teams that finish in the bottom three of the standings each season are relegated to the second tier of English soccer, known as the Championship. The top four teams qualify for the UEFA Champions League, which is the most high-profile club soccer tournament in the world featuring the best teams from Europe competing against each other from the group stages (in September) through to the final in May.

The top four teams qualify for the Champions League, although the fourth placed team must compete in the Champions League play-off (beginning in August) to qualify for the group stage. The fifth-placed team in the Premier League automatically qualifies for the UEFA Europa League, and the sixth and seventh-placed teams can also qualify, depending on the winners and runners-up of the two domestic competitions (FA Cup and League Cup); if the winner of the FA Cup qualifies for the Champions League, then that place will go to the runner-up, and if the runner-up is also already qualified, then that place will go to the next-best placed finisher in the Premier League. If the winner of the League Cup has already qualified, that place goes to the next-best placed team in the league.

A further place in the UEFA Europa League is also available via the Fair Play initiative. If the Premier League has one of the three highest Fair Play rankings in Europe (based on how few yellow cards or red cards each team receives, as well as the behavior of its supporters), the highest ranked team in the Premier League Fair Play standings that has not already qualified for Europe will automatically qualify for the UEFA Europa League first qualifying round (that typically begins in July).</h4>

<h3>The Spanish La Liga</h3>
<h4>History</h4>
<h4>The first football league in Spain was The Catalan football championship (Campionat de Catalunya), established in 1901. After the creation of the La Liga, The Catalan football championship co-existed with the national league for some years until it was cancelled in 1940.

La Liga, the first national football league in Spain was founded in 1929 (the first season started in February that year and ended in June). At this time, it consisted of one division, Primera División, and contained ten clubs. The numbers of clubs would later expand at several occasions. In 1987, it reached 20 clubs and that have remained except a short period (1995-1997) with 22 clubs.</h4>

<h4>League system</h4>
<h4>The first and second division was founded together in 1929. In 1977, Segunda Division B was founded to replace Tercera Division as the third tier. Tercera Division has since that been the fourth tier. An overview of the current national league system is presented in table 1.</h4>

<h4>Spanish football tiers</h4>
<h4>Primera Division (La Liga)	1</h4>
<h4>Segunda Division	2</h4>
<h4>Segunda Division B	3</h4>
<h4>Tercera Division	4</h4>
<h4>Below the forth tier the national football is played with regional divisions.</h4>

<h4>Qualification for European Cups</h4>
<h4>Nowadays, the top four teams in La Liga are qualified for the Champions League and the team that is placed fifth will get the chance to play in Europa League (one place also goes to the winner of the Copa del Rey).</h4>

<h4>Relegations</h4>
<h4>Nowadays, the three teams placed at the bottom of the table (places 18-20) of Primera Division are relegated to Segunda Division.</h4>

<h3>The German Bundesliga</h3>
<h4>History
<h4>German football leagues had existed long before the establishment of the Bundesliga, in 1898 was the first regional league, Southern German football championship, formed.</h4>

<h4>The top national clubs were invited to become the sixteen founding members of the Bundesliga. These were FC Kaiserslautern, FC Köln, FC Saarbrucken, FC Nurnberg, Meidericher SV, Eintracht Frankfurt, Borussia Dortmund, Eintracht Braunschweig, Karlsruher SC, Hertha BSC Berlin, Preusen Münster, VfB Stuttgart, Hamburger SV, TSV 1860 Munchen, Schalke 04 and Werder Bremen. FC Koln would win by a six points margin and Uwe Seller would be the top scorer with 30 goals for Hamburger.</h4>

<h4>League system</h4>
<h4>Bundesliga is the top level of the German football league system. The second division is since 1974 known as 2. Bundesliga and the third is since 2008 3. Liga since (previously Regionalliga that was founded 1963). An overview of the current national league system is presented in table 1.</h4>

<h4>German football tiers</h4>
<h4>1. Bundesliga	1</h4>
<h4>2. Bundesliga	2</h4>
<h4>3. Liga	3</h4>
Below the third tier are Non-Professional Leagues divided in regions.</h4>

<h3>The French Ligue 1</h3>
<h4>History and facts</h4>
<h4>Football became popular relatively late on the other side of the English Channel; for the French cycling was the prime sport. Nevertheless, in the 1890s football started to flourish in Paris and soon spread to other regions. The first national (although only Parisian team participated) competition was arranged in 1894. This was several decades before the introduction of professional football in the country though.

The first season of the professional league was played in 1932 and included 20 teams (at this certain season the league was called National), the same number of teams that are included in Ligue 1 today.

The winner has since 2007 received the “Hexagoal” trophy designed by Pablo Reinoso. It has replaced the old trophy, called “le Trophée de Ligue 1”, designed by d'Andrée Putman.

The 20 particpating clubs play against each other in home and away games, resulting in 38 for each team during a season. Since the 1994-95 season, three points are received for a win; for a draw, one point is received. Most points during a season was collected by Paris Saint-Germain in the 2015-2016 season (96).</h4>

<h4>League system</h4>
<h4>Ligue 1 is the top tier of the French football league system, one level above the current Ligue 2. The third to fifth level are called Championnat National (in English: French National Championship). An overview of the current league system in France is presented in table 1.</h4>

<h4>Below the fifth level follows a structure of several local regional leagues.</h4>

<h3>The Italian Serie A</h3>
<h4>History</h4>
<h4>An Italian National Championship was decided already in 1898 and Genoa Cricket & Athletic Club became the first champions, although the whole competition was decided upon one match.

For some more than two decades, the competition was divided into regional groups. During the period 1922-1929 different arrangement was tried until several interregional divisions was merging into one. At this time was also Serie B, the second highest division introduced. This coincided with a period in Italian football when the leading Fascist party dictated that no foreigners were allowed in the football league. This was counterweighed to a high degree by the import of Italian ancestries, so-called rimpatriato, from South America.

In 1964, the league became the Lega Serie A when the Lega Calcio was founded in replace of Italian Federal Football Association.

Scudetti, which is Italian for little shield has since the 1924 been a shield (i.e. logo) been awarded to the winner to wear on the shirt. The team winning the Serie A is often referred to winning the scudetto.</h4>

<h4>League system</h4>
<h4>Serie A is the top level of the Italian football league system. The second division was founded in 1929 and is known as Serie B. Some years later a third tier, Serie C was founded. An overview of the current national league system is presented in table 1.</h4>

<h4>Italian football tiers</h4>
<h4>Serie A	1</h4>
<h4>Serie B	2</h4>
<h4>Serie C	3</h4>
<h4>Below the third tier the league is played on semi- or non-professional levels with regional divisions.</h4>

<h4>Qualification for European Cups</h4>
<h4>The top three teams in Seria A are qualified for the Champions League (one place also goes to the winner of the Coppa Italia) and the teams that are placed 3-6 will also get the chance to play in European Cups.</h4>

<h4>Relegations</h4>
<h4>Since the season 2006-2007 the three teams placed at the bottom of the table (places 18-20) have been relegated to Serie B. In the 2005-2006 season only two teams were relegated. Before that two teams (places 18-20) were relegated directly and two teams (places 17-18) would go to playoffs consisting of a two-legged game in which the winner avoided relegation.</h4>
